# Course Enrollment Portal (Group 1)
Small class project. Stage 1 is for teachers to manage courses. Stage 2 is for students to search and enroll.

## Stage 1
- Teachers can make, edit, view, and delete courses.
- Each course needs name, description, subject, and credits.
- Show all courses on an index page.
- Add course page and edit course page.
- Deleting is wide open at first (any teacher can delete). Later only the creator can delete.

## Stage 2
- Students can log in.
- Students search by course name or number.
- Students add/drop courses and see their schedule.
- Permissions matter: students only change their own schedule; teachers manage courses.

## What We Currently Have
- One `index.html` with a basic layout and placeholder course examples.
- No routing yet.
- No backend yet.
- No login system yet.
- Frontend and backend will be built by the teammates handling those roles.
- Added a few helpful touches (IDs, basic structure, small comments) to make it easier for frontend to start.

## Roles
- Documentation & QA: tracks requirements, wrote this README, keeps notes updated, and later checks if features match the assignment.
- Frontend: will build the full design, styling, and actual pages.
- Backend: will build the server, database, and login system.
- PM: Is to be decided.

## How to View the Project
1) Clone or download the repo.
2) Open `index.html` in a browser (or use Live Server if you want auto-refresh).
